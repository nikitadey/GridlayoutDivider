# GridlayoutDivider
Grid layout manager that has different top and bottom and left right divider

Drawable for left items and right items as well as top and bottom items and span count should be passed in the constructor. 

it draws the divider based on span count.

I have added images of different grid layout that i created using this divider by changing the span count.
